\section{Related Work}

In this chapter we will cover some related work that represent use cases of topic modeling 
similar to our research question. They analyze either Lovecraft’s works or compare topics 
between Lovecraft’s works and films and other authors.\\

The first related work is the paper ‘Beyond the mountain of madness: a look at the shared 
themes of Edgar Allan Poe and H.P. Lovecraft’ by Kristoffer Gustafson. This paper compares 
the main themes of both H.P. Lovecraft and Edgar Allan Poe, another well-known author and 
poet. Poe heavily influenced Lovecraft’s fiction and literary style, as he stated in his 
essay ‘Supernatural Horror in Literature’. The author examines the themes of insanity, 
death and the gothic setting on both authors and projects similarities that suggest influence 
of Poe on Lovecraft.\\

Another paper is ‘The Lovecraft Look: An Examination of Lovecraftian Themes in Film’ by 
Michael A. Church. The author analyzes the philosophical beliefs and life experiences that 
inspired Lovecraft's "weird fiction" and his literary philosophy of "Cosmic Indifferentism" 
and compares them with films influenced by Lovecraft. Lovecraft's philosophy has been 
heavily misconstrued, as evidenced by several films that purport to adapt his stories, 
but actually ignore or misinterpret Cosmic Indifferentism. However, some films successfully 
adhere to Lovecraft's focus on cosmic horror and humanity's insignificance, even if they 
are not direct adaptations of his work. The important task of uncovering topics gets applied 
n this project to compare them between Lovecraft’s works and films.\\

The third related work, ‘Re-visioning Romantic-Era Gothicism: An Introduction to Key Works 
and Themes in the Study of H.P. Lovecraft’ by Philip Smith, is similar to our research 
question. The author examines the recurring themes of language, genre, literary influences, 
xenophobia, cosmic indifferentism, dreams, time and the influence of Lovecraft. Contrary 
to our work, this paper focusses on the criticism on Lovecraft. As we said in our research 
agenda, Lovecraft was known for racist slurs and in regard to our modern society, these 
have to be reflected on. The paper does not cover all of Lovecraft’s work and the key 
topics to be uncovered correlate to major critical responses.\\
